Hi,
This project has been created in IntelliJ.
The pom file contains all required dependencies.

TestRunner.Class available at in src/test/java/com.loveholidays/testRunner

Source code files:
- BookingPage.class
- Homepage.class
- DriverSetting.class
- TestTask.feature
- testTask_StepDef.class
- TestRunner.class

I've noticed today that for some cases user has been redirected to Availabilility Page Instead of Booking Page,
There is workaround for this issue which allows test to pass this step but throws exception message as System.out.println.
